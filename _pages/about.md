👨🏽‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at HEC Montréal, majoring in business analytics.

👨🏽‍💼 As a serial case competitor, I've traveled around the world to represent my university on both the national and global stages. My goal is to integrate this business expertise with practical ML applications to solve real-word problems.

🔬 My current interests lie in applied reinforcement learning and sports analytics.

# Portfolio projects

## 🔗 [Flappy Bird Reinforcement Learning Agent](https://github.com/ghj95/dqn_bird/blob/main/bird.ipynb){:target="_blank"} 
This reinforcement learning project **trains an agent to play Flappy Bird** using **Deep Q-Learning**, demonstrating advanced reinforcement learning in action. Built with *Stable Baselines 3* and *OpenCV*, it features a **custom game environment** that connects directly to the game interface through screen capture and input simulation. The implementation includes tailored reward structures that incentivize pipe navigation and performance visualization with TensorBoard, allowing real-time monitoring of the agent's learning progress as it masters increasingly complex gameplay strategies through trial and error.

## 🔗 [Iris Flower Classifier App](https://github.com/ghj95/iris_app){:target="_blank"}

  <p style="flex: 1;">
    This machine learning application <strong>classifies iris flowers</strong> using a <strong>random forest model</strong>, offering a hands-on demonstration of predictive analytics. Built with <em>Scikit-Learn</em>, it includes features such as real-time probability scoring and dynamic parameter selection, making it an interactive and flexible tool. Developed with <em>Streamlit</em>, the app provides a user-friendly interface for exploring machine learning concepts in classification and model performance evaluation.

<img src="./images/fl.gif" alt="Gif Frozen Lake" width="300px" style="float: right; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">
This AI project **implements Q-learning to solve the Frozen Lake environment** from **OpenAI Gymnasium**, demonstrating fundamental reinforcement learning principles. Built with *NumPy* and *Matplotlib*, it features a table-based approach where the agent learns optimal paths through a slippery grid to reach a goal while avoiding holes. The implementation includes **dynamic learning rate adjustment** and **epsilon-greedy exploration** that gradually shifts from exploration to exploitation. Performance metrics are tracked and visualized, showing the agent's improving success rate over time as it masters navigating this classic reinforcement learning challenge.

## 🔗 [Stock Portfolio Optimizer App](https://github.com/ghj95/port_opt){:target="_blank"}

  </a>
  <p style="flex: 1;">
    This project is designed to <strong>optimize stock portfolio allocations</strong> using <strong>modern portfolio theory</strong> and advanced risk assessment techniques. By implementing Monte Carlo simulations, the app estimates Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to enhance financial decision-making. It integrates the <em>Yahoo Finance API</em> and utilizes data analysis libraries such as <em>Pandas</em>, <em>NumPy</em>, and <em>Cvxp</em> for in-depth analysis and visualization.

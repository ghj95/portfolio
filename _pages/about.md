👨🏽‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at HEC Montréal, majoring in business analytics.

👨🏽‍💼 As a serial case competitor, I've traveled around the world to represent my university on both the national and global stages. My goal is to integrate this business expertise with practical ML applications to solve real-word problems.

🔬 My current interests lie in applying reinforcement learning to video game environments and leveraging neural networks for advanced sports analytics.

# Portfolio projects

## 🔗 [Stock Portfolio Optimizer App](https://port-opt.streamlit.app) 
This project is designed to **optimize stock portfolio allocations** using **modern portfolio theory** and advanced risk assessment techniques. By implementing Monte Carlo simulations, the app estimates Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to enhance financial decision-making. It integrates the *Yahoo Finance API* and utilizes data analysis libraries such as *Pandas*, *NumPy*, and *Cvxp* for in-depth analysis and visualization, providing users with a robust tool for portfolio management.

## 🔗 [Iris Flower Classifier App](https://iris-class.streamlit.app) 
This machine learning application **classifies iris flowers** using a **random forest model**, offering a hands-on demonstration of predictive analytics. Built with *Scikit-Learn*, it includes features such as real-time probability scoring and dynamic parameter selection, making it an interactive and flexible tool. Developed with *Streamlit*, the app provides a user-friendly interface for exploring machine learning concepts in classification and model performance evaluation.
